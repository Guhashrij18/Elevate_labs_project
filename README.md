**E-Commerce Return Rate Reduction Analysis using Power BI**

**Overview**
  This project focuses on identifying key factors contributing to product returns in e-commerce and reducing return rates using data analytics and visualization.
By integrating Python, SQL, and Power BI, the project uncovers actionable insights from order and return datasets and builds a predictive model to identify high-risk products.

**Objectives**

 * Analyze return rates across product categories, payment methods, and customer demographics
 * Predict the probability of product return using Logistic Regression
 * Create an interactive Power BI dashboard for visualizing return risk and trends
 * Provide data-driven recommendations to reduce overall return rates

**Tools and Technologies Used**

  Tool	Purpose
  Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn)	Data cleaning, preprocessing, and logistic regression modeling
  SQL	Querying and managing data
  Power BI	Building interactive dashboards and visual reports
  Excel/CSV	Data storage and export

**Steps Involved**

  Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
  Handled missing values and standardized formats
  Ensured non-returned products had empty return details
  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  Analyzed return percentage per category, supplier, and payment method

**Model Building**

  Built a Logistic Regression model to predict return probability
  Generated a return_risk_score for each product
  Dashboard Development (Power BI)
  Created visuals: return risk by category, reason distribution, and payment methods
  Added slicers and drill-through functionality for detailed product analysis
  Insights and Recommendations
  Identified high-risk categories and payment channels
  Suggested return policy improvements and supplier quality checks

**Key Insights**

  Clothing and Electronics have the highest return rates
  Major return reasons include "Defective" and "Not as Described"
  Credit card transactions show higher return tendencies
  Seasonal trends indicate mid-year and post-holiday peaks in returns

**Dashboard Highlights**

  Donut Chart: Return distribution by Risk Band
  Bar Chart: Average Return Risk by Product Category
  Column Chart: Return Risk by Payment or Shipping Method
  Drill-through Page: Product-level return reasons and timelines

**Deliverables**

  Python codebase for data cleaning, modeling, and scoring
  Power BI dashboard with filters and drill-through capabilities
  High-Risk Products CSV file
  Final Project Report (PDF and Word formats)

Conclusion

The analysis revealed that certain product categories and payment methods contribute disproportionately to return rates.
By combining predictive modeling with interactive visual insights, e-commerce businesses can identify high-risk products and improve operational efficiency.
Implementing data-driven decisions can reduce overall return rates and enhance customer satisfaction.
